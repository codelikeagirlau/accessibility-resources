# Accessibility Resources

This repository is an open-source project seeking contributions for resources and tools relating to web accessibility, and making the web better for everyone.

Currently this repo is a mess of notes and links... help us make it better!

## What is accessibility?

On the web, accessibility ensures that users with disabilities are able to use all facets of a website. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) defines accessibility standards and guidelines that all website designers and developers should comply with.

Accessibility is often pooled together with other web standards like performance, usability and security at the end of developing a web project though our aim is to make it a priority throughout all stages of web development. 


## Accessibility things to consider when creating web and digital products:

- POUR principles: Perceivable, operable, understandable, robust
- Video captions
- image descriptions
- Color blindness
- Bionic reading
- Sensory considerations
- Autoplay of sound and video
- Design features that are meaninful vs decorative
- Seperate css stylesheets for different access requierments (print, screen readers, colour blind, dark mode, slow connections)
- Image descriptions and alt text
- Text should always be written, not in a flat image
- Building websites for slow internet connections, with technologies e.g Lazy Load, optimized images, fallback, SWR etc

## Tools and Resources:

- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/): This validator checks the markup validity of Web documents in HTML, XHTML, SMIL, MathML, etc.
- [Who Can Use](https://www.whocanuse.com/)
- [Digital NSW Colour Contrast resource](https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/delivery/accessibility-and-inclusivity-toolkit/inclusive-design/colour-contrast)
- [Vic government typography and accessibility colour digital guide](https://www.vic.gov.au/typography-and-accessible-colour-digital-guide)
- [Bionic Reading chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bionic-reading/kdfkejelgkdjgfoolngegkhkiecmlflj/related)
- Otter AI

## Questions for digital teams and organisations to ask:

- What would an accessibility-first process for digital products look like?
- What would an accessibility pledge look like?
- How can digital teams bake accessibility into their process?
- How does an organisation prioritise accecessibility?

## Who in an org should be responsible for accessibilitiy?

- Designers:
- Content Writers:
- Devs and techies:
- QA and testers:
- Accessibility committees:

## Other notes and incomplete thoughts

- Accessibility on Instagram - how does Instagram incorporate accessibility?
- The Roboto font - apparently this font is accessibility friendly, was it designed with this in mind?
- Other fonts that are dyslexia friendly
- [Person sues Coles for poor accessibility](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/australia-customer-sues-coles-supermarkets-over-alleged-disability-discrimination-re-accessibility-of-website/)
- "Digital" isn't just about web - how do we consider accessibility in webinars and online events, emails, audio, etc
- Sometimes the robot is good - can we use AI tools ethically for accessibility,e g. Otter AI for transcripts and meeting summaries, ChatGPT for digesting information and reducing overwhelm etc
- Autoplay of music and video - MySpace songs. Context is key. TikTok "mute on entry" setting.
- Dark patterns e.g. cannot unsubscribe to service.
- How do we consider people who aren't as tech savvy in how we set up our websites / apps/ digital products?
- [Helping blind people learn to code](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/helping-blind-people-learn-to-code-c47c68d4a237/)
- Accessibility workshops?
- An accessibility-first website project would be a great portfolio piece (e.g. for someone looking for an internship)
